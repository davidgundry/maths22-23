# Giving Students Assessments in Chunks: Reflections on Mathematics and Problem Solving 2021-22

Mathematics and Problem Solving is a module that is assessed by coursework assessment, requiring the students to complete exam-style questions. Student outcomes in the years 20-21 and 21-22 are markedly different. In 20-21, the results were: 18% Non-submission, 48% fail, 34% pass In 21-22, these were: 11% Non-submission, 19% Fail, 70% pass. The pass rate on the first attempt (not considering resits) more than doubled.

## Differences in Teaching

20-21 was taught entirely online due to Covid with the "lecture" part consisting of pre-recorded lectures and interactive exercises and the "practical" part on Microsoft Teams, where students were given exercises to do and I attempted to support learning.

21-22 was taught entirely in-person. Lecture/practicals were combined into a single four-hour session. Lecture-style content was interspersed with exercises for the students to complete and I used this time to give one-to-one or small group support.

It was much easier to get students to engage offline than online. The number and usefulness of conversations with students about work was much higher when taught in person. Students were less able to obfuscate what work they had or had not done. I think this is due to the social pragmatics of the different situations: it is seen as more socially acceptable to not engage online than it is to not engage in person.

## Differences in Assessment

The assessment in 20-21 was delivered in two chunks, the first delivered in week 9 with deadline in week 12. The second delivered in week 12 with a deadline one month later. The first part was (depending on counting) 43 questions, worth 60 marks, the second part was 27 questions worth 40 marks. In total 60 questions were asked, and the whole assessment was marked out of 100.

The assessment in 21-22 was delivered in ten chunks. Each chunk was first handed out on paper during a lecture. During the many pauses in the lecture for exercises, those students who had completed the exercises often started work on their assessment while they waited for the lecture to continue. A Moodle quiz was set up for each week, and students were encouraged to enter their answers as soon as possible to avoid having to do so later. It was possible for students to revise their answers at any time before the deadline. These submissions were not marked until the end of the course.

Overall the assessment consisted of 236 questions, marked out of 255. The marks per section varied between 18 and 36. The length of the assessment made it possible to structure it differently. Rather than a single question covering an entire technique, groups of questions were often asked that all required variations on the same technique, for example simplifying summations of increasing complexity, or converting numbers into multiple different bases. The easiest questions were easier than the 20-21 assessment. Often a group of related questions started with a simple question. The questions were individually smaller, requiring fewer steps to complete. This also made marking clearer: most questions were worth 1 mark for a correct answer or 0 otherwise.

## Discussion

There was a significant increase in pass rate in Mathematics and Problem Solving between 20-21 and 21-22. Student engagement was also much higher.

A goal I had in teaching maths in 21-22 was to get the students _practicing_ what they had learned much sooner, both by incorporating exercises in the lectures and giving out the assessment week by week in chunks. I think this was helpful: students tended to realise they did not understand content when they attempted to answer a question on it. If this realisation occurred early, it was easier for them to seek help to understand. Furthermore, the requirement to immediately practice what they learn made it relevant to them to pay attention to the taught content.

Students were motivated to practice their learning on the assessment questions because they knew it was contributing to their assessment, and decreasing the amount of work they would need to do later. Additionally, unlike the online exercises in 20-21, in 21-22, the social expectations of the classroom setting pressured students to engage. I could see and check - either on paper or through Moodle - what students had done, and if necessary remind them of the importance of doing the work. The length of the assessment allowed me to put in easier questions to decrease the barrier to getting started, and if there were questions they could do, it may have inspired feelings of competence which is known to be helpful for motivation.

The additional length of the assessment also made silly mistakes cost students fewer marks, as proportionally it was a smaller part of their overall grade.

However, students often asked to get marks and feedback on what they had done. This could not be provided as all the marking had to be done at the end of the course. It was also hard encourage students to submit what work they had done on Moodle before the deadline: if the student had completed the questions on paper, they saw little benefit to them of copying it up in advance although this was helpful for me to see their performance. Giving each chunk it's own deadline through the course might help. Students would also get practice at the mechanics of submitting an assignment.

## Recommendations

I think that there was a significant benefit of "chunking" the assessment for Maths 21-22. In the future, I suggest that the course should do the following:

* Deliver the assessment in several chunks throughout the course, ideally given to students in-lecture so they can start working immediately
* Make the overall assessment longer with more questions that individually require less work
* Make it a requirement to submit work during the course rather than all at the end
