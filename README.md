Staff should

* Inform those in attendance that a recording is taking place.
* Make attendees aware of any areas of the room that are most likely to be out of range of the filming if they have an objection to being filmed.
* Make attendees aware of who they can contact in the School if they have a concern about being included in any recording.
* Contact the Data Protection Officer if any attendees raise a concern or complaint relating to data protection or privacy (us@yorksj.ac.uk).
* Consider whether recordings should be stopped, for example for discussions likely to involve sensitive content, or significant audience participation, such as pre planned question and answer sessions.
* Take into account whether any personally identifying or sensitive content should be edited prior to publication on the VLE.
